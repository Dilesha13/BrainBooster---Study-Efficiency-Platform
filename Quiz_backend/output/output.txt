"Army ants could teach robots a thing or two  \nArmy ants use their bodies to build bridges. Robots could soon take a cue from the tiny insect\u2019s \nability to collaborate.  \nBY ANDREW PAUL  | PUBLISHED NOV 22, 2023 1:00 PM EST  \n \nApart from their nasty stings, army ant colonies are often known for their stunning, intricate \narchitectural feats using their own bodies. When worker ant hunting parties encounter \nobstacles such as fallen tree branches, gaps in foliage, or small streams, the tiny insects will join \nforces to create a bridge for the remaining ant brethren to traverse. It\u2019s as impressive as it is \nsomewhat disconcerting \u2014these are living, crawling buildings, after all. But one research team \nisn\u2019t studying the coordination betwe en miniscule bugs to benefit future construction projects; \nthey are looking into how army ant teamwork could be mimicked by robots.  \n \n\u201cArmy ants create structures using decentralized collective intelligence processes,\u201d Isabella \nMuratore, a postdoctoral researcher at the New Jersey Institute of T echnology specializing in \narmy ant building techniques, explains to PopSci over email. \u201cThis m eans that each ant follows \na set of rules about how to behave based on sensory input and this leads to the creation of \narchitectural forms without the need for any prior planning or commands from a leader.\u201d  \n \n \n \nAlong with engineers from NJIT and Northwestern University, Muratore and her entomologist \ncolleagues developed a series of tests meant to gauge army ant workers\u2019 reactions and logistical \nresponses to environmental impediments. After placing obstacles in th e ants\u2019 forest paths, \nMuratore filmed and later analyzed the herds\u2019 subsequent adaptations to continue along their \nroutes. Utilizing prior modeling work, the team also tested whether the ant bridges could \nwithstand sudden, small changes in obstacle length using an adjustable spacing device.  \n \nMuratore and others recently presented their findings at this year\u2019s annual Entomological \nSociety of America conference. According to their observations, army ants generally choose to \nconstruct bridges in the most efficient locations \u2014places wide enough to necessitate a building \nproject while simultaneously using the least number of ants possible. The number of bridges \nneeded during a sojourn also influences the ants\u2019 collective decisions on resource allocation.  \n \nDavid Hu, a Georgia Institute of T echnology engineering professor focused on fire ant raft \nconstructions during flooding, recently likened the insects to neurons in one big, creepy -crawly \nbrain while speaking to NPR on the subject. Instead of individual an ts determining bridge \ndimensions and locations, each ant contributes to the decisions in their own small way.  \n \nMuratore and her collaborators believe an army ant\u2019s collaborative capabilities could soon help \nengineers program swarms of robots based on the insect\u2019s behavior principles and brains. Ants \nvary across species, but they still can pack a surprising amount o f information within their \nroughly 1.1 microliter volume brains.  \n \nReplicating that brainpower requires relatively low energy costs. Scaling it across a multitude \nof robots could remain comparatively cheap, while exponentially increasing their functionality. \nThis could allow them to \u201cflexibly adapt to a variety of challen ges, such as linking together to \nform bridges over gaps of different lengths in the most efficient manner possible,\u201d Muratore \nwrites to PopSci.  \nRobotic teamwork is crucial to implement the machines across a number of industries and \nscenarios, from outer space exploration, to ocean cleanup projects, to search -and-rescue \nefforts in areas too dangerous for humans to access. In these instances, coordi nating quickly \nand efficiently not only saves time and energy, it could save lives.  "
